*January 13. 2014*
We will use a State-Transition System

*1/14/14*
We will use both toy problems/puzzles and real-world problems in this class.

1.initial state

2.set of possible actions
  - successor function: 
  - successor function + intial state
  -path (the solution)

3.goal

4.path cost function
  -for optimality
  -assumption: path cost = sum of step costs
